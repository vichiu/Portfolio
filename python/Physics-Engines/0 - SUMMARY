Using python, I created a very basic ASCII-based physics engine that simulates the bouncing of one or more ball objects
within a user-defined grid using kinematic equations.  This was developed purely as a personal exercise in python.

Programming Features:
- Object-oriented classes
- Called functions
- Imported functions
- Conditional for/while loops
- User input
- Error handling
- Global and local variables
- Array manipulation
- Position, velocity, acceleration, and power in two dimensional vector space
- Rotational velocity, acceleration, inertia, and power
- Frictional forces based on material type
- Bounded bouncing behavior
- Real-time kinematic calculations (not predefined)
